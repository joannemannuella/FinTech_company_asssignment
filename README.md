***Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?***

Zip intended customers typically  would be slightly older, slightly more financially savvy than users of other buy now, pay later services,*[Peter Gray on "financial review" title "Zip stands by 2.5 million customer target" by Sally Patten](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/zip-stands-by-2-5-million-customer-target-20200320-p54c9x#:~:text=%22Typically%20our%20customers%20would%20be,such%20as%20groceries%20and%20petrol.)*. It currently has around 81,000 retail partners and over 9,900,000 customers.As of March 2021, Zip Co's market cap was $5.83 billion [sourced wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A). 

***What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)***

Their main product Zip Pay enable users to shop just about everywhere where most other platform not, whether is online and instore. They provide users the flexibility to set users repayment schedule according to their lifestyle from weekly, fortnightly, or monthly when the biggest competitor for example Afterpay provide less flexible payment plan . Zip also allows users to pay bills, manage your subscriptions, buy gift cards and earn rewards when you use the Zip app.Unlike AfterPay, Zip Co doesn’t break purchases into four or six instalments, instead consolidating account balances into a single ‘wallet’ and charging a minimum monthly repayment on the total according to [Stockhead](https://stockhead.com.au/company/zip-co-z1p/). For new users Afterpay limit the amount of purchase to a smaller limit compared to Zip Pay that has three tier of credit options $350, $500 and $1,000. Altough if users  approved for the smaller limits on Zip Pay, the flat fee for late payments could means users will be efectively be paying a higher rate of interest than customers with a higher Zip Pay limit this also means more than users could be paying on a credit card.

## Recommendations

In my recommendation to to offer instant integrations for their users for example Afterpay offered this service making it easy for business to plug payment system directly to business website. Afterpay highly advertised their instant integration with Magento, WooCommerce, Neto, Shopify, Island Pacific, Infinity, Futura4Retail, and Commerce Vision whether Zip pay have less platform in their compatibility only with Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, and Neto.

Besides that, AfterPay offers "comprehensive technical support for initial integrations and ongoing maintenance whenever users need it" when Zip pay recommended to contact their integration specialists which not guarantee on going support.

I personally think this will open more business oportunity to boost the number of users, in my observation users do not mind paying for services where it give them most convinience and that is what exactly After Pay offering.
